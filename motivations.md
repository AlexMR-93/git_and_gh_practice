motivations

 my biggest motivation is that i made a ton of mistakes as i grew up.
 i was always getting into trouble.  i became a father at 19 years old and
 once that happened, i felt that my parents hopes of me making it out of this old small town vanished.

 now i am 28 and a father of 2 babies. one is 8 and the other is 5. i have an amazing wife that pushed me to do turing. although i make a livable wage for us. i was not happy at my job.
